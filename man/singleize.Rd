\title{Remove back-to-back duplicates of a pattern in a string.}
\usage{
singleize(string, pattern)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{A character vector. The string(s) to be purged of duplicates.}

\item{pattern}{A character vector. Pattern(s) specified like the pattern(s)
in the stringr package (e.g. look at \code{\link[stringr:str_locate]{stringr::str_locate()}}). If
this has length >1 its length must be the same as that of \code{string}.}
}
\value{
The string with the duplicates fixed.
}
\description{
If a string contains a given pattern duplicated back-to-back a number of
times, remove that duplication, leaving the pattern appearing once in that
position (works if the pattern is duplicated in different parts of a string,
removing all instances of duplication). This is vectorized over string and
pattern.
