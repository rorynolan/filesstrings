\description{
Say you want to ensure a name is fit to be the name of a csv file. Then, if
the input doesn't end with ".csv", this function will tack ".csv" onto the
end of it. This is vectorized over the first argument.
}
\examples{
give_ext(c("abc", "abc.csv"), "csv")
give_ext("abc.csv", "pdf")
give_ext("abc.csv", "pdf", replace = TRUE)
}
