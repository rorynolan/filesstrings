file.move(files, destinations)

\item{files}{A character vector of files to move (relative or absolute
paths).}

\item{destinations}{A character vector of the destination directories into
which to move the files.}

\description{
Move specified files into specified directories
}
\details{
If there are \eqn{n} files, there must be either \eqn{1} or \eqn{n}
directories. If there is one directory, then all \eqn{n} files are moved
there. If there are \eqn{n} directories, then each file is put into its
respective directory. This function also works to move directories.

If you try to move files to a directory that doesn't exist, the directory is
first created and then the files are put inside.
