### 2.6.0

#### NEW FEATURES

#### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Improvements to documentation.


### 2.5.0

#### NEW FEATURES
* Improvement to `all_equal()` and its documentation.

#### BUG FIXES

### 2.4.0

#### NEW FEATURES
* Added `nth_number_after_mth()` and friends (there are 8 friends).

### 2.2.0

#### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Speed up `extract_numbers()`.

### 2.1.0

#### NEW FEATURES
* There is a new function `match_arg()` for argument matching which is inspired by  `RSAGA::match.arg.ext()`. Its behaviour is almost identical but `RSAGA` is a heavy package to depend upon so `filesstrings::match_arg()` might be handy for package developers.

#### BUG FIXES
* Fix to `all_equal()` for dealing with arrays.

by following Giorgio Spedicato's answer at
