Description: This started out as a package for file and string manipulation. 
    Since then, the 'fs' and 'strex' packages emerged, offering functionality
    previously given by this package (but slightly better). Those packages have
    hence almost pushed 'filesstrings' into extinction. However, it still has
    a small number of unique, handy file manipulation functions which can be 
    seen in the vignette. One example is a function to remove spaces from all 
    file names in a directory.
