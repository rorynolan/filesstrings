\usage{
number_ts_img(img, def, frames_per_set, overlapped, thresh, swaps, filt)

brightness_ts_img(img, def, frames_per_set, overlapped, thresh, swaps,
  filt)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{The calculated number or brightness time series image series.}

\item{def}{The number or brightness definition used.}

\item{frames_per_set}{The number of frames used in the calculation of each
point in the number or brightness time series.}

\item{overlapped}{A boolean. \code{TRUE} indicates that the windows used to
calculate consecutive brightnesses over time were overlapped, \code{FALSE}
indicates that they were not.}

\item{thresh}{A positive integer, possibly an object of class
\link[autothresholdr:th]{autothresholdr::th}. If the different channels of the image had different
thresholds, this argument may be specified as a vector or list (of positive
integers, possibly objects of class \link[autothresholdr:th]{autothresholdr::th}), one element for
each channel.}

\item{swaps}{A non-negative integer with an attribute \code{auto}. If the
different channels of the image had different \code{swaps}, this argument may be
specified as a list (of non-negative integers with attributes \code{auto}), one
element for each channel. For undetrended images, set \code{swaps = NA}.}

\item{filt}{A string, the filtering method used. Must be either \code{"mean"} or
\code{"median"}, or \code{NA} for no filtering. If the different channels of the
image had different filters, this may be specified as a character vector,
one element for each channel.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{number_ts_img} or \code{brightness_ts_img}.
}
\description{
The \code{number_ts_img} and \code{brightness_ts_img} classes are designed to hold
objects which are images calculated from the \emph{number and brightness}
technique.
}
\details{
An object of class \code{number_ts_img} or \code{brightness_ts_img} is a 3- or
4-dimensional array of real numbers with 4 attributes:
\describe{\item{\code{def}}{Are we using the \code{"N"} or \code{"n"} definition of number,
or the \code{"B"} or \code{"epsilon"} definition of brightness?} \item{\code{thresh}}{A
positive integer, possibly an object of class \link[autothresholdr:th]{autothresholdr::th} detailing
which threshold and thresholding method was used in preprocessing (in the
multi-channel case, one threshold per channel is given).} \item{\code{swaps}}{A
non-negative integer indicating the number of swaps used for Robin Hood
detrending, with an attribute \code{auto} which is a logical indicating whether or
not the parameter was chosen automatically (in the multi-channel case, one
\code{swaps} per channel is given).} \item{\code{frames_per_set}}{A positive integer
detailing how many frames were used in the calculation of each point in the
number or brightness time series.} \item{\code{overlapped}}{A boolean. \code{TRUE}
indicates that the windows used to calculate consecutive brightnesses over
time were overlapped, \code{FALSE} indicates that they were not.}}
