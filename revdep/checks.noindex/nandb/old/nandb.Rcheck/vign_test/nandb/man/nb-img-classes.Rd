\title{Number and brightness image classes.}
\usage{
number_img(img, def, thresh, swaps, filt)

brightness_img(img, def, thresh, swaps, filt)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{The calculated number or brightness image.}

\item{def}{The number or brightness definition used.}

\item{thresh}{A positive integer, possibly an object of class
\link[autothresholdr:th]{autothresholdr::th}. If the different channels of the image had different
thresholds, this argument may be specified as a vector or list (of positive
integers, possibly objects of class \link[autothresholdr:th]{autothresholdr::th}), one element for
each channel.}

\item{swaps}{A non-negative integer with an attribute \code{auto}. If the
different channels of the image had different \code{swaps}, this argument may be
specified as a list (of non-negative integers with attributes \code{auto}), one
element for each channel. For undetrended images, set \code{swaps = NA}.}

\item{filt}{A string, the filtering method used. Must be either \code{"mean"} or
\code{"median"}, or \code{NA} for no filtering. If the different channels of the
image had different filters, this may be specified as a character vector,
one element for each channel.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{number_img} or \code{brightness_img}.
}
\description{
The \code{number_img} and \code{brightness_img} classes are designed to hold objects
which are images calculated from the \emph{number and brightness} technique.
}
\details{
An object of class \code{number_img} or \code{brightness_img} is a 4-dimensional array
of real numbers in the mould of an \link[ijtiff:ijtiff_img]{ijtiff_img} (indexed
as \code{img[y, x, channel, frame]}) with 4 attributes: \describe{\item{\code{def}}{Are
we using the \code{"N"} or \code{"n"} definition of number, or the \code{"B"} or \code{"epsilon"}
definition of brightness?} \item{\code{thresh}}{A positive integer, possibly an
object of class \link[autothresholdr:th]{autothresholdr::th} detailing which threshold and
thresholding method was used in preprocessing (in the multi-channel case, one
threshold per channel is given).} \item{\code{swaps}}{A non-negative integer
indicating the number of swaps Robin Hood detrending, with an attribute \code{auto}
which is a logical indicating whether or not the parameter was chosen
automatically (in the multi-channel case, one threshold per channel is
given).}\item{\code{filt}}{Was mean or median filtering used in postprocessing?}}
