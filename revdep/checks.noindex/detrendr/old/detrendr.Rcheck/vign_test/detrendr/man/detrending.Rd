\arguments{
\item{img}{A 4-dimensional array in the style of an
\link[ijtiff:ijtiff_img]{ijtiff_img} (indexed by \code{img[y, x, channel, frame]})
or a 3-dimensional array which is a single channel of an
\link[ijtiff:ijtiff_img]{ijtiff_img} (indexed by \code{img[y, x, frame]}).}

\item{swaps}{The number of swaps (giving of one count from rich to poor) to
perform during the \emph{Robin Hood} detrending. Set this to "auto" (the
default) to use Nolan's algorithm to automatically find a suitable value
for this parameter (recommended). For multi-channel images, it is possible
to have a different \code{swaps} for each channel by specifying \code{swaps} as a
vector or list.}

\item{quick}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), the swap finding routine is run
several times to get a consensus for the best parameter. If \code{TRUE}, the
swap finding routine is run only once.}

\item{l}{The length parameter for \emph{boxcar} detrending. The size of the
sliding window will be \code{2 * l + 1}. This must be a positive integer. Set
this to "auto" to use Nolan's algorithm to automatically find a suitable
value for this parameter (recommended). For multi-channel images, it is
possible to have a different \code{l} for each channel by specifying \code{l} as a
vector or list.}

\item{purpose}{What type of calculation do you intend to perform on the
detrended image? If it is an FFS (fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy)
calculation (like number and brightness), choose 'FFS'. If it is an FCS
(fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) calculation (like cross-correlated
number and brightness or autocorrelation), choose 'FCS'. The difference is
that if \code{purpose} is 'FFS', the time series is corrected for non-stationary
mean and variance, whereas if \code{purpose} is 'FCS', the time series is
corrected for non-stationary mean only. `purpose`` is not required for
\emph{Robin Hood} detrending.}

\item{parallel}{Would you like to use multiple cores to speed up this
function? If so, set the number of cores here, or to use all available
cores, use \code{parallel = TRUE}.}

\item{tau}{The \eqn{tau} parameter for \emph{exponential filtering} detrending.
This must be a positive number. Set this to "auto" to use Nolan's algorithm
to automatically find a suitable value for this parameter (recommended).
For multi-channel images, it is possible to have a different \code{tau} for each
channel by specifying \code{tau} as a vector or list.}

\item{cutoff}{In \emph{exponential filtering} detrending, for the weighted
average, every point gets a weight. This can slow down the computation
massively. However, many of the weights will be approximately zero. With
cutoff, we say that any point with weight less than or equal to \code{cutoff}
times the maximum weight may be ignored; so with \code{cutoff = 0.05}, any
weight less than 5\% of the maximum weight may be ignored. The default
value of this parameter is sensible and its value should not be set to
anything else without good reason.}

\item{degree}{The degree of the polynomial to use for the polynomial
detrending. This must be a positive integer. Set this to "auto" to use
Nolan's algorithm to automatically find a suitable value for this parameter
(recommended). For multi-channel images, it is possible to have a different
\code{degree} for each channel by specifying \code{degree} as a vector or list.}

\description{
Correct images for bleaching (or any other effect that introduces an unwanted
trend) by \emph{detrending}.
}
\details{
There are 4 detrending methods available: \emph{Robin Hood}, \emph{boxcar},
\emph{exponential filtering} and \emph{polynomial}. \emph{Robin Hood} is described in Nolan
et al., 2018. The others are described in Nolan et al., 2017. \itemize{\item
\emph{Robin Hood} is a method whereby counts are taken from frames with higher
mean intensity and given directly to frames of lower intensity. \item
\emph{Boxcar} detrending with parameter \eqn{l} is a moving average detrending
method using a sliding window of size \eqn{2l + 1}. \item \emph{Exponential
filtering} detrending is a moving weighted average method where for parameter
\eqn{tau} the weights are calculated as exp\eqn{(- t / tau)} where \eqn{t} is
the distance from the point of interest. \item \emph{Polynomial} detrending works
by fitting a polynomial line to a series of points and then correcting the
series to remove the trend detailed by this polynomial fit.}
