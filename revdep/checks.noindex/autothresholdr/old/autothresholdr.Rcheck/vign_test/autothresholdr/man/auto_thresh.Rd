\title{Automatically threshold an array of non-negative integers.}
\usage{
auto_thresh(int_arr, method, ignore_black = FALSE,
  ignore_white = FALSE, ignore_na = FALSE)

auto_thresh_mask(int_arr, method, ignore_black = FALSE,
  ignore_white = FALSE, ignore_na = FALSE)

auto_thresh_apply_mask(int_arr, method, fail = NA,
  ignore_black = FALSE, ignore_white = FALSE, ignore_na = FALSE)

mask(int_arr, method, ignore_black = FALSE, ignore_white = FALSE,
  ignore_na = FALSE)

apply_mask(int_arr, method, fail = NA, ignore_black = FALSE,
  ignore_white = FALSE, ignore_na = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{int_arr}{An array (or vector) of non-negative \emph{integers}.}

\item{method}{The name of the thresholding method you wish to use. The
available methods are \code{"IJDefault"}, \code{"Huang"}, \code{"Huang2"}, \code{"Intermodes"},
\code{"IsoData"}, \code{"Li"}, \code{"MaxEntropy"}, \code{"Mean"}, \code{"MinErrorI"}, \code{"Minimum"},
\code{"Moments"}, \code{"Otsu"}, \code{"Percentile"}, \code{"RenyiEntropy"}, \code{"Shanbhag"},
\code{"Triangle"} and \code{"Yen"}. Partial matching is performed i.e. \code{method = "h"}
is enough to get you \code{"Huang"} and \code{method = "in"} is enough to get you
\code{"Intermodes"}. To perform \emph{manual} thresholding (where you set the
threshold yourself), supply the threshold here as a number e.g. \code{method = 3}; so note that this would \emph{not} select the third method in the above
list of methods.}

\item{ignore_black}{Ignore black pixels/elements (zeros) when performing the
thresholding?}

\item{ignore_white}{Ignore white pixels when performing the thresholding? If
set to \code{TRUE}, the function makes a good guess as to what the white
(saturated) value would be (see 'Details'). If this is set to a number, all
pixels with value greater than or equal to that number are ignored.}

\item{ignore_na}{This should be \code{TRUE} if \code{NA}s in \code{int_arr} should be
ignored or \code{FALSE} if you want the presence of \code{NA}s in \code{int_arr} to throw
an error.}

\item{fail}{When using \code{auto_thresh_apply_mask()}, to what value do you wish
to set the pixels which fail to exceed the threshold? \code{fail = 'saturate'}
sets them to saturated value (see "Details"). \code{fail = 'zero'} sets them to
zero. You can also specify directly here a natural number (must be between
\code{0} and \code{2^16 - 1}) to use.}
}
\value{
\code{auto_thresh()} returns an object of class \link{th} containing the
threshold value. Pixels exceeding this threshold pass the thresholding,
pixels at or below this level fail.

\code{auto_thresh_mask()} returns an object of class \link{arr_mask} which is a
binarized version of the input, with a value of \code{TRUE} at points which
exceed the threshold and \code{FALSE} at those which do not.

\code{auto_thresh_apply_mask()} returns and object of class \link{threshed_arr} which is the original input masked by the
threshold, i.e. all points not exceeding the threshold are set to a
user-defined value (default \code{NA}).

\code{mask()} is the same as \code{auto_thresh_mask()} and \code{apply_mask()} is the same
as \code{auto_thresh_apply_mask()}.

\description{
These functions apply the ImageJ "Auto Threshold" plugin's image thresholding
methods. The available methods are "IJDefault", "Huang", "Huang2",
"Intermodes", "IsoData", "Li", "MaxEntropy", "Mean", "MinErrorI", "Minimum",
"Moments", "Otsu", "Percentile", "RenyiEntropy", "Shanbhag", "Triangle" and
"Yen". Read about them at \url{http://imagej.net/Auto_Threshold}.
}
\details{
\itemize{\item Values greater than or equal to the found threshold
\emph{pass} the thresholding and values less than the threshold \emph{fail}
the thresholding.

\item{For \code{ignore_white = TRUE}, if the maximum value in the array is one of
\code{2^8-1}, \code{2^12-1}, \code{2^16-1} or \code{2^32-1}, then those max values are ignored.
That's because they're the white values in 8, 12, 16 and 32-bit images
respectively (and these are the common image bit sizes to work with). This
guesswork has to be done because \code{R} does not know how many bits the image
was on disk. This guess is very unlikely to be wrong, and if it is, the
consequences are negligible anyway. If you're very concerned, then just
specify the white value as an integer in this \code{ignore_white} argument.}

\item{If you have set \code{ignore_black = TRUE} and/or \code{ignore_white = TRUE} but
you are still getting error/warning messages telling you to try them, then
your chosen method is not working for the given array, so you should try a
different method.}

\item For a given array, if all values are less than \code{2^8}, saturated value
is \code{2^8 - 1}, otherwise, saturated value is \code{2^16 - 1}. }
