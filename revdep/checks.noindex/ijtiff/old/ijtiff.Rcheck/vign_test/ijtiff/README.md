## Introduction

This is a general purpose TIFF I/O utility for R. The [`tiff`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tiff) already exists for
this purpose but `ijtiff` adds some functionality and overcomes some
bugs therein.

  - `ijtiff` can write TIFF files whose pixel values are real
    (floating-point) numbers; `tiff` cannot.
  - `ijtiff` can read and write *text images*; `tiff` cannot.
  - `tiff` struggles to interpret channel information and gives cryptic
    errors when reading TIFF files written by the *ImageJ* software;
    `ijtiff` works smoothly with these images.

To learn about `ijtiff` and how to use it, visit the package website at
<https://ropensci.github.io/ijtiff>.

## Installation

### `libtiff`

`ijtiff` requires you to have the `libtiff` C library installed. To
install `libtiff`:

  - On **Debian Linux**, try `sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev`, or if
    that fails, try  
    `sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev`.
  - On **Fedora Linux**, try `sudo yum install libtiff5-dev`, or if that
    doesnâ€™t work, try  
    `sudo yum install libtiff4-dev`.
  - On **Mac**, you need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then in the
    terminal, run `brew install libtiff`.
  - On 64-bit **Windows**, no setup is required ðŸ˜„. If you have 32-bit
    windows, you need to install `libtiff` from
    <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm>.

### Installing the release version of the `ijtiff` R package

You can install `ijtiff` from CRAN (recommended) with:

``` r
install.packages("ijtiff")
```

### Installing the development version of the `ijtiff` R package

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/ijtiff")
```

## Acknowledgement

This package uses a lot of code from the original `tiff` package by
Simon Urbanek.

## Advice for Package Authors

If youâ€™re authoring a package which is to depend on `ijtiff` and youâ€™re
using AppVeyor, be sure to force AppVeyor to use 64-bit architecture.
This avoids some peculiarities of 32-bit AppVeyor which cause `ijtiff`
installations to fail. You can see how to do this in the
[appveyor.yml](appveyor.yml) file in this repository.
