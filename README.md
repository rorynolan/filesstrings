This started out as a package for file and string manipulation. Since
then, the `fs` file manipulation package and the \`strex string
manipulation package emerged, offering functionality previously given by
this package (but slightly better). Those packages have hence almost
pushed ‘filesstrings’ into extinction. However, it still has a small
number of unique, handy file manipulation functions which can be seen in
the
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=filesstrings/vignettes/files.html).
One example is a function to remove spaces from all file names in a
directory.
